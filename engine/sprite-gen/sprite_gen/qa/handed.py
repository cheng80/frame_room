"""`sprite-gen handed-check` — is a colour-marked item on the side its handedness puts it, in every frame?

A still or loop of a character with an asymmetric item (`handedness.parse`: "the black smartwatch=left
wrist") is checked against where that item belongs in the view (`handedness.placement`). The item is
found by its colour: `--marker` is a colour the item has and nothing else on the character has (a
watch's glowing screen, a red ribbon). Per frame, the pixels of that hue are grouped into blobs and
each blob's centre is compared with the body's own centre (the mean x of its opaque pixels):

- a view with a picture side (front, back, the diagonals): every blob must be on that side;
- the item in two places (two blobs farther apart than a link distance, the smaller at least a quarter
  of the larger; smaller ones are specks of compression tint) fails in every view;
- the near side of a diagonal view: the item must show in at least half the frames; of a side view, in at
  least three quarters (a near arm is in view the whole walk; a far arm's item shows about half of it);
- the far side of a side view, an item on the swinging end of an arm (a wrist, a hand: `handedness.limb`):
  the arm swings out in front of the body with each step and the item shows then, whole. Every blob must
  be in front of the body — on the facing side of its centre by at least a tenth of the body's height — and
  with `--state walk` or `run` it must show in at least a quarter of the frames. An item that also shows at
  or behind the body's centre is on the near arm, the wrong one;
- the far side of a side view, any other item (a pin on the far side of the head, an anklet): hidden or a
  sliver — no blob may be larger than half the item seen whole, measured on `--reference` pictures of the
  same character (front or back, the item in full view);
- the near side of a side view, against `--reference`: a frame shows the item only when it is more than
  that sliver, so a far sliver turned over to face the other way does not count as the near item shown.
  Against a reference a sliver is also not judged for where it is. Without one the size rules are not
  checked (`far_hidden` / `near_whole`), and the report says so.

The screen colour cannot see the item's band without its marker — a watch's bare strap on the other arm.
`--strap` names the band's colour (usually dark) and `--zone` the rows the item sits in (black is common:
outlines, a hat, motion smear on the legs); a band of that colour outside every marker blob, wider and
taller than an outline, is another place the item shows. Specks of the marker's hue that a clip's colour
blocks leave on outlines are recorded and not judged.

A picture turned over moves the item: a front view turned over puts it on the wrong side; a side walk facing
right (the item on the far arm, in view while that arm is forward) turned over to face left shows it in too
few frames for a near arm; one facing left (the item on the near arm, crossing the body) turned over to face
right shows it behind the body's centre. So a set that made its left-hand views by mirroring fails here
(`tests/qa/test_handed_check.py` proves it).
Pixels cannot judge everything — an unmarked item, an item drawn on the wrong hand where it stays hidden —
so `--board` draws every frame with its blobs ringed (green as expected, red not) for a person to look at.
