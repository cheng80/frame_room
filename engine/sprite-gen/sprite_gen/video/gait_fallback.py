"""A second look for a walk or run cycle when the automatic search finds none.

Two things a front or back gait does that the first search cannot see past:

* It walks toward the camera (or away from it) although it was asked to stay in place, so the
  body grows or shrinks through the clip and the same pose never matches itself in size. A
  linear trend in the subject's height measures that; the frames are scaled back to the first
  frame's size about the subject's foot point, which stays where it was filmed. Horizontal and
  vertical drift are left to the motion analysis, which already measures them.
* It walks slowly. A calm walk in long clothing can take longer than half the clip per cycle,
  the most the first search confirms. The second search allows a cycle up to
  `LONG_CYCLE_FRACTION` of the clip: it is still seen once whole and repeating for the rest.

Only a failed search reaches the long window. The size is also held before the first search
(`video-loop --size-hold auto`, the default for `--anchor motion-auto`): a clip that changes size
by `SIZE_HOLD_MIN` or more is scaled back first, so the loop is cut on frames of one size and its
last frame leads into its first. What was done is recorded in the report (`size_hold`,
`gait_fallback`).

The hold reads the change one cycle on (`cycle_drift`), not off a line fitted through the
clip: a clip that starts from a standing pose and settles into the walk over its first steps
(knees bending, the body leaning in) is shorter from then on, and a line through every frame
reads that one change of pose as a body that shrinks all the way. The same pose a cycle later
is the same size unless the body really grows or shrinks, so the hold compares each frame's
height with the frames whole pose-matched lags later and takes the middle of those changes; the
few frames of the first pose do not move a median of the rest.
