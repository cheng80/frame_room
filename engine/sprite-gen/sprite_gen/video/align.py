"""`sprite-gen video-cycle-align` — one cycle length for every direction of a set.

Each direction of a walk is filmed on its own, so its cycle comes out its own length (a Lite
set measured 16 to 27 frames). A game that turns a character mid-stride wants every direction
to be the same number of frames and to start on the same step. So every loop of the set is
resampled to the set's median length L*: frame k of the new loop is the source loop at time
k·L/L* (cyclic, offset 0), so a time that lands on a source frame takes that frame as filmed
and only the times between two frames are made by RIFE — each kept unless it smeared or lost its
outline, where the nearer source frame is taken instead (`--between auto`, the default; `rife`
keeps every made frame and warns, `nearest` makes none). Then each loop is turned to start as a
heel lands — read off the stride, the lowest row or the body's top line (`foot_strike`), never off
the frame's top edge, which a long ear owns. docs/loop-repair.md section 4.

Every frame between two source frames softens a little, so the length is the median (the one
that needs the fewest made frames across the set), and a loop already that long is not touched.

A loop whose cut holds each drawing for two or three frames (`held_drawings`, sprite_gen/video/
held.py), that the length leaves at under RETAKE_DRAWINGS_MIN drawings a second, with frames
between them that could not be made, is aligned all the same — and named in the report's `retake`
(reason `held-drawings`, with its numbers) and in a warning: the gap is wider than any interpolator
bridges, and only a new take fixes it.

The loop directories are `video-loop` output directories. Their first alignment keeps the cut
as filmed in `cycle.source/`; every later alignment reads from there, so running it again — or
with another length — never resamples a resampled loop.

Resampling to one length assumes every loop holds one cycle. A loop that holds two (a cut that
took two strides as one) would come out walking twice as fast as the rest, and pixels cannot tell
it from a loop of one stride whose two steps look alike. So each loop is screened first
(`cycle_screen`, sprite_gen/video/period.py): a half or a third of it that returns to a pose on
the motion's path makes it a suspect. A set with a suspect is stopped before anything is rewritten
(`--multi-cycle warn` aligns it as it is and says so), the report naming each suspect
(`suspects`). The count comes back from whoever looked: `--cycles <loop>=1` aligns that loop as
it is, `--cycles <loop>=k` takes one cycle — a k-th of it, from the start whose frame one cycle on
is the most like it — out of the loop as filmed (`take_cycle`) and aligns that. Nothing changes the
number of cycles in a loop but `--cycles`.

Where a loop's view cannot tell its feet apart (`start_foot` null, with `foot_why`), it starts on its
larger strike, and the report names it under `unnamed_feet` with its two strike frames as they now
stand in `cycle/` (`candidates`, the first being the frame it starts on) — for whoever looks, a
person or a vision model. The answer comes back the same way as a count: `--foot <loop>=left|right`
says which own foot lands on the first candidate, and that loop alone starts as `--start-foot` lands
(half a cycle on, where the other foot lands first), recorded `start_foot_source: "given"`.

A set that needs a made frame where no RIFE is installed raises `rife.RifeNotInstalled` with
nothing rewritten: this command fails on it, `video-set` skips the alignment with a warning.
