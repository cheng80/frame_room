"""RIFE in-betweens for RGBA sprite frames, through the external `rife-ncnn-vulkan` binary.

Where it runs, what it costs and why this build: docs/loop-repair.md section 1. RIFE reads
three colour channels and no alpha, so a frame is interpolated as two images — its colour and
its coverage as a grey image — and put back together. The two are two runs of the flow, and
where legs cross they do not agree: the coverage says body where the colour run still carries
what lay around the body. So around the body the colour image holds the body's own colour,
pushed out from inside its outline (`bleed`): a disagreement there reads as the body, not as the
black a frame premultiplied over black put under it (2.24 and before: a black smear between
crossing legs). Inside the coverage the colour is the frame's own, outline included.
`smear` measures what a made frame has that neither neighbour has, and the outline it lost where
the flow failed and melted a limb into the fill (docs/loop-repair.md section 4).

The binary's own CPU path (`-g -1`) returns a wrong frame with rife-v4.6 on both macOS and
Linux (measured 2026-10-03: mean error 39 against 3.3 through Vulkan), so it is never passed;
a machine without a GPU runs the Vulkan path on Mesa's llvmpipe, which gives the GPU's frame.

The binary is found by SPRITE_GEN_RIFE, then on PATH, then where `sprite-gen rife install`
puts it (`install_root()`, docs/loop-repair.md section 1). A RIFE that cannot be found is
`RifeNotInstalled`, which a caller may answer by cutting the loop as filmed with a warning; a
RIFE that is found and then fails is `RifeUnavailable` and always an error.

The interpolator is a plain callable `(a, b, t) -> frame`, so a caller can be handed a stand-in
(`Interpolate`), and a test needs no binary.
