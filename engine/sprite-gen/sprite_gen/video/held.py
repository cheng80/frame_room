"""Held drawings: a clip that shows each drawing for two or three frames, and how many it shows a second.

A video model may film a walk at 12 drawings a second inside a 24 fps clip: each drawing is shown
twice ("on twos"), or three times ("on threes"). Played at its own rate such a loop is ordinary
limited animation. Stretched to a longer cycle (`video-cycle-align`), the frames between are made
by an interpolator across a gap two or three times as wide as one frame of an every-frame clip, and
where the legs swap places in that gap no interpolator can draw them (docs/loop-repair.md section 4).

The second frame of a pair is rarely a byte copy: the model redraws it a little, so its step from
the first is small but not zero. A rule that calls a step held when it falls under a fraction of the
median step fails exactly there: with half the steps held, the median falls between the held and
the moving steps, and a fraction of it is smaller than many of the held steps. So the judgement
reads the rhythm, not one step at a time: in a clip on twos every second step is small, on threes two
of every three, and a motion filmed every frame has no such rhythm — its steps swell and shrink
with the stride, a dozen frames or more, never every second or third frame.

`measure` reads it off the steps between neighbouring frames (the distance `video-loop` cuts by):
for a hold h of 2 or 3, in windows of WINDOW steps, the phase whose every h-th step is the change
and the rest are held, scored by `contrast` — the held steps over the change steps (their medians:
a frame repeated now and then, as a 20 fps clip carried at 24 repeats one in six, moves a median
not at all), the median over the windows. A hold whose contrast is under CONTRAST_MAX is the clip's
hold; each step is then held when it is nearer the held steps than the change steps (under the
geometric midpoint of their means), and the drawings are the frames that begin one.

A clip may hold its drawings for only part of its length. `measure_cycle` reads the cycle cut out of
it on the clip's own steps over the cut (one window's worth at least, SPAN_MIN_STEPS), so a loop is
held where it was cut, not where most of its clip was.
