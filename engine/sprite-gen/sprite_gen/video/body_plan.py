"""Body plan: what a clip's subject stands and walks on, so no sentence names a part the body lacks.

The engine's measured walk and idle sentences were measured on people, and some name what only a person
has: the Lite walk's arm swing (`batch.LITE_WALK_TEXT`), the arms in the Lite back-diagonal head hold
(`LITE_HEAD_TEXT`), the idle's two feet, chest, shoulders and arms (`MOTION_TEXT["idle"]`), and the front
or back walk's mid-step redraw, one foot under each hip and the arms swinging (`WALK_START_TEXT`), and the
front, back and diagonal still a clip starts from, both feet, chest, hips and shoes (`STILL_VIEW_TEXT`), the
attack's bare hands and grip (`MOTION_TEXT["attack"]`, `HOLD_TEXT["attack"]`), and the sheet rows `prepare` writes
(`prepare.STATE_REQUIREMENTS`: a walk's arm and leg, a front walk's shoulder, a wave's hand). Said of a
horse, they walk it on a person's legs, stand it up on two or strike with its hands. The caller names the body plan (`parse`,
`--body-plan`, also `prepare --body-plan`): one for the character ("quadruped"), or one per figure in a scene
("the man=biped", "the horse=quadruped").

| plan | stands on | the engine says |
|---|---|---|
| biped | two legs | the measured sentences, as without a body (the default) |
| quadruped | four legs | it stays on all four legs and never rises onto its hind legs |
| legless | no legs | it has no legs and never grows any; no mid-step redraw (no step to catch) |

The still a clip starts from is drawn with a view sentence (`batch.still_view_text`, `gen --direction`)
that counts a person's feet and names the chest, hips, shoulders and shoes; a body that is not one biped
gets it without them, ending in what it stands on (`still_text`).

No body, or one biped, is the 2.22.0 prompt (a sheet row, 2.32.0's) to the byte (`tests/gen/test_prompt_freeze.py`). Any other
body gets the sentences without the parts it lacks and, after the motion sentence, what it stands on
(`text`); a scene of several figures says it per figure. Only the biped sentences were measured; the
others say no part the body lacks and are not yet measured on a clip.
