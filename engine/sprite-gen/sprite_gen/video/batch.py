"""`sprite-gen video-set` — directions x states, end to end, one report per item.

For every (direction, state) pair: canvas -> `sprite-gen video` -> frames -> loop.
Clip generation is rate-limited by the xAI team quota (2 requests/second measured
2026-09-08: five parallel POSTs produced two HTTP 429s), so starts are staggered
and a 429 gets a bounded, logged retry. Stages are idempotent — an item whose
clip already exists reuses it unless `--force` — and a failure stops only that
item, never the batch. The batch ends with `set.report.json` and `table.md`; an
item that failed is listed with its stage and error, never silently dropped.
