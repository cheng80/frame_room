"""Jump frames in a walk loop, found by how much the body's coverage changes, replaced by RIFE.

A video model redraws thin hair a little differently every frame, and now and then a ponytail
lands somewhere it was not one frame earlier: one step of the loop changes far more than the
loop's usual step. That step is a jump; the frame after it is replaced by the frame RIFE makes
half-way between its two neighbours, and every other frame stays the video's own
(docs/loop-repair.md section 2). Re-making every frame instead (an offset of half a frame) also
softens the frames that were fine, and was judged "not corrected" (2026-10-03).

Measured on the loop as it plays — cyclic, the last frame followed by the first — and inside
the union box of the body over the whole loop, the way the strip cells are cut, so a frame's
score does not depend on where the canvas put the body.
