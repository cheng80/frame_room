"""Attaching the engine's sentences to a prompt: the one place pieces go on.

A prompt is the caller's own text and then the engine's pieces: the view sentence, the turn over a
reference, where a handed item is, the key background line, the layout guide; for a clip the side view's
hold. Every piece goes on through `Prompt.add`, and each goes on only where its condition holds:

- every piece but the handed one goes on as 2.22.0 attached it. The prompts a character with no handed
  item is drawn and filmed from are frozen at 2.22.0, to the byte (`tests/gen/test_prompt_freeze.py`); a
  change to them waits for a before-and-after comparison on the app's default clip model;
- the key background line is left out when the prompt already names a key background (`ALREADY_SAID`), as
  2.22.0 did;
- the handed piece (`ONCE_ONLY`) drops a sentence the prompt already carries, word for word: a start still's
  prompt handed back to `gen --direction --handed` already has it. Its arm sentences (the arms swing, the far
  arm's item shows when that arm comes forward) are there only for an item on an arm
  (`handedness.limb`).

The caller's text is never edited. Where it and a piece disagree (`facing left` in the text, `--facing
right` on the command) or it repeats what a piece says, `Prompt.notes` says which words, and the verb
prints them: the engine cannot tell which of the two the caller meant.
