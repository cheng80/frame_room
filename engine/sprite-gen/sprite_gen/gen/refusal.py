"""What a provider refusal line says about why the provider refused.

The line shape is a contract other programs read:

    <verb>: <reason> (HTTP <n>)[ code=<code>][ key=value ...]<tail>: <body>

`(HTTP <n>)` stays exactly that — callers find the provider status with
`\\(HTTP (\\d{3})\\)` — and `code=` follows it after one space. The code is the
provider's own machine code (`error.code`, which OpenAI's image guide calls the
stable discriminator), and only when it looks like an identifier. When the code
is one the provider documents as a content-policy block, `<reason>` is the fixed
marker `CONTENT_POLICY`, so a caller can tell "change the request" from auth,
quota or parameter errors without knowing any provider's vocabulary.

`<body>` is the provider's error body as received — JSON on one line, anything
else as its text — so an open-source tool shows the whole error and the product
that wraps it decides what its own users see. Only two things are masked
(`masked`): strings shaped like an API key (the credential the request carried
among them) and the query string of a URL, where a signature lives. The mask
runs on each string of the body as the provider sent it, before the body is put
on one line, so no quote or escape this module writes can hide a key from it.
The body comes last, so nothing in it can move what a caller reads off the front
of the line.
