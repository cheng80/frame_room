"""Handedness: which of the character's own sides an asymmetric item is on, seen from each view.

A watch on one wrist, a pin on one side of the head, a bag on one shoulder: turned over, the
picture puts the item on the other side. A character like that has its left-facing views drawn,
not mirrored, and each drawing is told where the item goes. The caller names the item and its
side once (`parse`: "the black smartwatch=left wrist"); the engine works out where that side is in
each view (`placement`) and says it in the still and clip prompts (`text`).

Where the character's own left side is, by view and facing (the side view and the three-quarter
views turn to `facing`; front and back have none):

| view | facing right | facing left |
|---|---|---|
| front | the picture's right | (same) |
| back | the picture's left | (same) |
| side | the far side, behind the body | the near side, toward the viewer |
| front_diagonal | the picture's right, on the far side | the picture's right, on the near side |
| back_diagonal | the picture's left, on the far side | the picture's left, on the near side |

A view turned to the right shows the character's right side; turned to the left, its left. The
own right side is the mirror of every row. A side view puts both arms over the middle of the body,
so it has no picture side, only near and far.

The far side of a side view is hidden behind the body, except for what swings out from behind it.
A walking character's far arm comes forward of the body with every step, and what its wrist or hand
wears shows then. An item there (`limb`: `SWINGING_ARM_PARTS`) is therefore drawn and filmed as
showing whenever that arm is out in front of the body, and the near arm stays bare; a walk or run
with one also says the arms swing (`ARMS_SWING_TEXT`). Said as hidden, and never named in the clip,
a watch on the far wrist was in no frame of a walk at all (2.22.0). Every other part (an ear, the
head, a tail, the body, a leg, a shoulder, the upper arm) keeps the 2.22.0 sentences: hidden on the far
side, and no arm sentence for it.
