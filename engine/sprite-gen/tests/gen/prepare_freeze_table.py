"""Every row prompt `prepare` writes for a character with no body plan, drawn through `prepare.run`.

The sheet rows were measured on people, and a body plan (`--body-plan`, 2.33.0) changes only what is said
to a body that is not one biped. This table is the evidence that a run with no body plan, or one biped, is
the 2.32.0 run to the byte: it draws every row prompt for every state with a sentence of its own (the walk
and run rows, the diagonal runs, the wave and the jump), the default states, a state with no sentence,
with and without a base image, and a direction-contract run, through the entry point 2.32.0 already had —
so the same code runs against the tag's source and records what it wrote.

Record (from the repo root, the tag's source unpacked somewhere):

    git archive 44d6242 | tar -x -C /tmp/sprite-gen-2.32.0
    python tests/gen/prepare_freeze_table.py /tmp/sprite-gen-2.32.0 tests/fixtures/prepare-rows-v2.32.0.json.gz

`tests/gen/test_prompt_freeze.py` draws the table again against this tree and compares.
