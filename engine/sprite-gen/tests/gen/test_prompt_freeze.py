"""Without `--handed`, every prompt string the engine sends is 2.22.0's, to the byte.

`prompt_freeze_table.py` draws each prompt a character with no handed item is drawn or filmed from — a clip
(built-in or `--motion`, every model and pin), `video-prompt`, a still (view, facing, reference, key line,
layout guide, the `--facing-fix regen` regeneration), `video --direction side` and the mid-step redraw — and
`tests/fixtures/prompts-v2.22.0.json.gz` is that table drawn from the 2.22.0 tag's source (`013355b`). These
tests draw it again against this tree.

What is compared is the prompt strings only. The notes and warnings a verb prints beside a prompt (`gen`
stderr and `extra.prompt_notes`, `video-prompt` `warnings` and `notes`, `video-set` `prompt_notes`) are not
part of the freeze and may differ.
